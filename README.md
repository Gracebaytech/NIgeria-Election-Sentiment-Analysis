Uncovering Public Sentiment in Nigerian Elections through Sentiment Analysis
"Uncovering Public Sentiment in Nigerian Elections through Sentiment Analysis" is a project that seeks to understand public opinion and emotions regarding the Nigerian elections. 
The project employs sentiment analysis techniques using the Twitter API to extract tweets and perform analysis to determine the polarity (positive, neutral or negative) of the public's emotions towards the elections and its candidates.
The project leverages the use of Python libraries such as Tweepy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to perform the sentiment analysis and data visualization. The project will highlight the benefits and limitations of sentiment analysis, and its potential impact on the election process.
